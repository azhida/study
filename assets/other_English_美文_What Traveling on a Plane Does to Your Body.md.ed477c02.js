If you&#39;re planning on being one of them soon, you might not be looking forward to the unpleasant feeling air travel often leaves you with.</p><p>Besides the airport crowds and stress, travelling at a high altitude has real effects on the body.</p><p>Although the pressure of the cabin is adjusted to prevent altitude sickness, you could still experience sleepiness or a headache.</p><p>The lower oxygen pressure found in an aircraft cabin is equivalent to that at 6,000-8,000 feet of altitude.</p><p>A drop in oxygen pressure can cause headaches in certain individuals. To help prevent headaches, drink plenty of water, and avoid alcohol and coffee.</p><p>Airplane food might not really be as tasteless as you originally thought. The air you breathe in a plane dries out your mouth and nose, which can affect your sense of taste.</p><p>Perception of sweet and salty foods dropped by almost 30 percent in a simulation of air travel.</p><p>However, you can make your taste buds active again by drinking water. A dry mouth may reduce taste sensitivity, but taste is restored by drinking fluids.</p><p>Although in-flight infections thrive in dry environments like airplanes, your risk of getting sick from an airplane is actually low because of the air filters used.</p><p>Unless you&#39;re sitting next to someone who is coughing or sneezing, you shouldn&#39;t worry too much about getting sock.</p><p>However, bacteria have been shown to live on cabin surfaces, so wash your hands frequently.</p><p>datetime: 2022.06.13. 07:47</p>',13),r=[s];function i(l,d,h,p,u,c){return o(),a("div",null,r)}const g=e(n,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
