# The Serenity of the Moment

It was one warm evening many years ago.
那是多年前一个温暖的夜晚。

After spending nearly every waking minute with Angle for eight straight days, I knew that I had to tell her just one thing.
在连续八天几乎每时每刻都和Angle在一起之后，我知道我必须告诉她一件事。

So late at night, just before her fell asleep, I whispered it in her ear.
所以在深夜，就在她快要睡着的时候，我在她耳边悄悄说了这句话。

She smiled  -- the kind of smile that makes me smile back -- and she said, "When I'm seventy-five and I think about my life and what it was like to be young, I hope that I can remember this very moment."
她笑了——那种微笑让我也报以微笑——她说:“当我75岁的时候，回想我的生活，回想年轻时的感觉，我希望我能记住这一刻。”

A few seconds later she closed her eyes and fell asleep.
几秒钟后，她闭上眼睛睡着了。

The room was peaceful -- almost silent. All I could hear was the soft purr of her breathing.
房间里很平静——几乎是一片寂静。 我能听到的只有她轻柔的呼吸声。  

I stayed awake thinking about the time we'd spent together and all the choices in our lives that made this moment possible.
我一直醒着，想着我们一起度过的时光，以及让这一刻成为可能的生活中的所有选择。  

And at some point, I realized that it didn't matter what we'd done or where we'd gone. Nor did the future hold any significance.
在某个时刻，我意识到我们做过什么或者去了哪里并不重要。未来也没有任何意义。

All that mattered was the serenity of the moment. Just being with her and breathing with her.
重要的是此刻的宁静。和她在一起，和她一起呼吸。

We must not allow the clock, the calendar, and external pressures to rule our lives and blind us to the fact that.
我们不能让时钟、日历和外部压力控制我们的生活，让我们看不到这样一个事实。

Each individual moment of our lives is a beautiful mystery and a miracle -- especially those moments we spend in the presence of a loved one.
我们生命中的每一刻都是美丽的神秘和奇迹——尤其是那些我们与所爱之人在一起的时刻。
