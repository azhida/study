# Twenty Dollars
A well known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20 bill.
一个著名演说家拿着一张20美元的纸币开始它的演讲。

In the room of 200, he asked. "Who would like this $20 bill?"
在200人的房间里，他问：“谁想要这张20美元的钞票？”

Hands started going up. He said, "I am going to give this $20 to one of you. But first, let me do this."
很多人举手。他说：“我将会把这张20美元钞票给到你们其中一位。但在这之前，让我做这样的事情。”

He proceeded[开始行动] to crumple[弄皱] the 20 dollars note. He then asked. "Who still wants it?" Still the hands were up in the air.
他开始把这张美元钞票弄皱。然后问道：“谁还想要？”依然有很多人举手。

"Well," he replied, "what if I do this?" He dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe.
“很好，”他回应，“如果我这么做呢？”他把纸币扔到地上，开始用鞋使劲踩踏。

He picked it up, now crumple and dirty. "Now, who still wants it?"
他把它捡起来，它又皱又脏。“现在，谁还想要？”

Still the hands went into the air.
仍然有许多手举在空中。

"My friends, you have all learned a very valuable lesson.
我的朋友们，你们都学到了非常宝贵的一课。

No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20."
不管我对钱做了什么，你仍然想要它，因为它没有贬值。它仍然值20美元。

Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way.
在生活中，很多时候，我们被自己所做的决定和身边的环境所抛弃、蹂躏，甚至碾入尘土。

We feel as though we are worthless; but no matter what happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value.
我们觉得自己一文不值;但无论发生了什么，或将要发生什么，你都不会失去你的价值。

Dirty or clean, crumpled or finely creased, you are still priceless to those who love you.
无论你肮脏或干净，皱巴巴的或被折磨，对爱你的人来说，你仍然是无价的。

The worth of our lives comes, not in what we do or who we know, but in who we are.
我们生活的价值不在于我们做了什么，或我们认识谁，而在于我们是谁。

You are special; don't ever forget it."
你是特别的;永远不要忘记。
